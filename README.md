# controlling_arduino_with_usb_joystick
In this repository is the code I wrote in processing with the libraries firmata and GCP, in order to control a robotic arm, MeArm, with a PS4 control Bluetooh and Arduino. However, this code can be used for other purposes with an Arduino and also with other GCP compatible controls.
